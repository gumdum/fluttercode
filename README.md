FlutterCode.com website development

This is a resource dedicated to the expansion of the Dart/Flutter community. The intent is to be a viable alternative providing community interaction similiar to pub.dev. 

The expectation is to develop a simple web and app frontend to pub.dev which provides more detailed and relevant search feature capabilities. In addition the standard favorite, comments, star rating, etc will be available for each element in pub.dev.

This is a simple front end to pub.dev and not a replacement. All code is stored and submitted to pub.dev.
